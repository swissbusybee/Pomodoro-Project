Pomodoro Project

A vanilla Javascript project for theOdinProject. It has an optional "progress bar" element of tracking the % of time until completion.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system where you work for a period of time then take a short break, then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on.

We have made a Pomodoro clock which will count down twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again.
